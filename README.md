# Applied-Computer-Science

I try to give a weekly computer science lecture at my workplace. These are my lecture notes. I've been at this for about a year now and the notes are slowly building up to a proper book. This is a Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike 4.0 endeavor. This book will remain in draft form until I leave this organization. Whenever I leave I will freeze additions and start seriously revising the old content and seek peer reviews. Right now the bibliography is completely broken and I'm not sure why. The references worked just fine on Overleaf. I have migrated many of the figures from PNG/JPG to PDF. PDFs from GraphViz are much smaller and look much better than raster graphics.

## Ideas for future chapters
- Priority queue, heapsort
- Dynamic arrays, amortized analysis
- GPS and linear algebra
- Big Integers, Karatsuba, divide-and-conquer
- Serialization at the Presentation Layer
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Splay, Red-Black)
- Troubleshooting techniques
    - Follow-the-path
    - Divide-and-conquer
    - Spot-the-difference
    - Rubber ducky
    - Elimination
    - Dartboard
    - Logs
    - Memory and intuition
