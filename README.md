# Applied-Computer-Science

I try to give a weekly computer science lecture at my workplace. These are my lecture notes. My goal is for each lecture to be small enough in scope to be deliverable in one hour. I've been at this for about a year now and the notes are slowly building up to a proper book. This book will remain in draft form until I leave this organization. Whenever I leave I will freeze additions and start seriously revising the old content and seek peer review.

Right now the bibliography is completely broken and I'm not sure why. The references worked just fine on Overleaf. Some chapters contain thorough references and others have none.

I have migrated many of the figures from PNG/JPG to PDF. PDFs from GraphViz are much smaller and look much better than raster graphics.
